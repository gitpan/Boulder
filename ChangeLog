	* (version 1.28)
	* Boulder::Store fixes from Aaron Wangberg

	* (Version 1.27)
	* Batch entrez queries work again using semi-published, semi-private interface
	  The problem with the published interface is there's no way to pass a list of
	  Genbank ACCESSION numbers, just GI numbers.  So I have to use the XML demo.
	* Patches from Michael Peterson to fix BLAST parsing.
